# Mass_registration
#React application with emphasis on authentication and security for Holy Mass service registration, built for the [St. Mark Mission, London Website](http://www.stmarkmission.com). (Also my creation... but made using WordPress!!)

Since the beginning of the pandemic, places of religious services have been asked to restrict the number of participants attending services while maintaining social distancing norms. Hence it was important to have a registration service as part of the mission website where parishioners could come and register their details while blocking seats for a given service available on a sunday. 

This can enable the church authorities for:
  1. Have the ability to restrict participation to 50 people per service (as adviced by the government)
  2. Have details of the attendees in case the authorities want to cross check for contact tracing or other issues. 
  
 To this end, the above application is being created.
